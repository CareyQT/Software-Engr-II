Product - TermWise

Term wise is a project started by Eduardo, Quinn and Gendor to help OSU students create a valid, term-by-term class plan for an academic year (and beyond) by automatically applying constraints like prerequisites, co-requisites (where supported), and which terms a course is offered. The system should reduce planning mistakes and time spent cross-checking multiple OSU sites.
