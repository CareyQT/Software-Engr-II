  TermWise is a web app that helps Oregon State University students build a term-by-term plan without repeatedly hunting through the catalog, scheduler, and prerequisite pages. Students select a major (starting with Computer Science), enter completed/planned courses, and drag classes into Fall/Winter/Spring/Summer terms. As the plan is built, TermWise checks prerequisites and term offerings, warns about invalid sequences, and summarizes credit load and progress. The goal is to reduce planning mistakes (e.g., missing prerequisites or waiting a full year for a course), reduce time spent cross-referencing sources, and make it easier to iterate on “what-if” plans before registration. Our MVP focuses on a reliable course database, prerequisite validation, and a simple planner UI, with optional grade/GPA calculation to support academic decision-making.
